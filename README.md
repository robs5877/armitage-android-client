## Production Environment

This source code was generated using:

```sh
Android Studio: 4.1.2
GRADLE: 6.5
JAVA: 1.8
Android SDK: 26
Buid tools: 29.0.2
```


## Development

The app is still buggy & the reason I worked on importing this code because I'm learning coding android apps.
here is a list of what's not working

```sh

> Widgets: Session Details & FileBrowser Plugin
> Attack Wizard
> If SSL option in settings is not checked the app will crash
> ~~Sending commands in console is not working (fixed)

```
